We have sourced our healthcare data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through their Diabetes Atlas of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) platform, accessible at the following link: https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/diabetesatlas-sdoh.html.
This wonderful resource provides an in-depth examination of diabetes prevalence and its relationship to many social determinants of health. 

In our analysis, we focus on the interaction between diabetes and major factors like obesity and inactivity, on their deep relationships and public health implications. 

We hope to contribute to a better knowledge of these health issues using ML models and to inform evidence-based actions to promote the well-being of impacted individuals and communities by harnessing this data.
